## DESCRIPTION
Lost Dungeons is an indie like videogame programmed in its entirely in java. In the game, you play as a wizard whose objective is to escape a dungeon full of skelletons and traps. The player needs to activate all the levers throughout each level to escape the dungeon. <br>
The mechanics of the game are as follows: 

- Move around the 2D space and jump (use arrows and space bar)
- Throw fireballs at enemies to defeat them (press F)
- Dash/Teleport some space ahead (press D)
- The wizard can only endure up to 2 hits, the third one will reset the level
- Falling into lava pits will instantly reset the level.


All these features are implemented by respecting the pilars of OOP:
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
  
Please keep in mind that this version only contains one level to adapt to the constraints of the class.

To run the game, the only requirement is to have a jdk compiler set in the computer. Please note that jdk versions older than jdk-20 might not work
